My dataset consists of responses to tweets posted by Trump during 2 days. The data is sorted according to tweet ID numbers. I would be interested in the following
1. Sentiment Analysis Overall
2. Sentiment Analysis by Trump's Tweet (So, if the sentiment was different in response to his tweet)
3. Word Frequency Overall
4. Word Frequency by Tweet
